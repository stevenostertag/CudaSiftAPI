     * @brief Options controlling SIFT feature extraction.
     *
     * These parameters govern the Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG) keypoint
     * detector and the SIFT descriptor computation.  Typical defaults are
     * shown in square brackets after each field.
     *
     * -- Detector thresholds ----------------------------------------------
     *
     *   thresh_        [~2.0-5.0]
     *       Contrast threshold applied to DoG extrema.  A candidate
     *       keypoint is accepted only when its absolute DoG response
     *       exceeds this value.  Higher values reject low-contrast
     *       features and produce fewer, more stable keypoints.
     *       Lower values retain weaker features at the cost of more
     *       noise. Think of a higher value as a bigger magnitude difference
     *       between the keypoint and its neighbors in the DoG scale-space.
     *
     *   lowest_scale_  [~0.0]
     *       Minimum feature scale (in pixels of the original image)
     *       that will be kept.  Keypoints whose estimated scale is
     *       below this cutoff are discarded.  Set to 0.0 to keep all
     *       detected scales.  Increasing this suppresses very
     *       fine-grained features.
     *
     *   edge_thresh_   [~10.0]
     *       Edge rejection threshold (ratio of principal curvatures).
     *       Candidates whose (trace²/determinant) of the 2×2 Hessian
     *       exceeds this limit are considered edge responses rather
     *       than corners and are discarded.  Lower values are stricter
     *       (reject more edges); higher values are more permissive.
     *       Lowe's original paper uses (r+1)²/r with r=10, giving
     *       a value of ~12.1.
     *
     * -- Scale-space construction -----------------------------------------
     *
     *   init_blur_     [~1.0]
     *       Assumed blur level (sigma) of the input image.  The
     *       library applies a low-pass filter so that the effective
     *       blur of the base image matches the first scale of the
     *       Gaussian pyramid. A value of 0.0
     *       means the input is essentially unblurred.
     *
     *   num_octaves_   [5]
     *       Number of octave levels in the scale-space pyramid.  Each
     *       successive octave halves the image resolution.  The
     *       library will silently clamp this to the maximum feasible
     *       value based on the image dimensions (approximately
     *       log2(min(width,height)) - 3), and emit a warning if the
     *       requested count exceeds that limit.  More octaves detect
     *       larger-scale features but increase computation.
     *
     * -- Capacity ---------------------------------------------------------
     *
     *   max_keypoints_ [~8192]
     *       Maximum number of keypoints that will be returned.  This
     *       controls the size of the pre-allocated SiftData buffers
     *       on both host and device.  If the detector finds more
     *       candidates than this limit, the excess are silently
     *       dropped.  Set this high enough for your application to
     *       avoid losing valid features.
     *
     * -- Post-extraction filtering ----------------------------------------
     *
     *   scale_suppression_radius_  [0.0 = disabled]
     *       When > 0, enables scale-based non-maximum suppression
     *       after extraction.  For every detected keypoint, any
     *       smaller-scale keypoint whose centre lies within
     *       ``scale_suppression_radius_ * larger_scale`` pixels is
     *       removed.  This keeps only the dominant-scale feature in
     *       each spatial neighbourhood, eliminating redundant
     *       detections of the same object at finer scales.
     *
     *       A value of 6.0 corresponds to the SIFT descriptor patch
     *       radius and is a good starting point.  Set to 0.0 (the
     *       default) to disable suppression entirely.
